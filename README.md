Running main.py:
1. The code minimally requires Python 3.6 or higher.
2. Run the main.py script from the command line or PowerShell. For
instance, in PowerShell navigate to where the .py files exist, with the
command ’cd your folder path’. Then type ’python main.py’.
3. Ensure that the necessary dependencies such as NLTK library are
preinstalled.

Options in main.py:
1. ’t’: Train the language model on a corpus file. Specify the number
of tokens (n) to concatenate in an n-gram and provide the filename.
2. Ideal range for (n) in this model would be 1-5.
3. Ensure that the file name has a .txt extension.
4.  ’g’: Generate text from the trained language model. Choose to print
the text to the screen (’p’) or write it to a file (’w’).
5. ’e’ : Exit the program at any time.
6. ’b’ : Go back to the initial prompt.
